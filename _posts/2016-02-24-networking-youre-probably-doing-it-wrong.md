# Networking: You're Probably Doing It Wrong

If you were asked to take each person you know and categorize them under just one label: colleague, friend, relative, or associate---could you? If you answered "yes," your social graph isn't quite social enough. Social graphs aren't about contacts, categories, or caliber---they're about relationships.

We've all met people who pride themselves on their networking cred. They boast about their LinkedIn contacts and brandish thousands of business cards at every conference. But those aren't genuine relationships---they're just contacts.

The human brain is a network of neural activity; connections become stronger the more they get used. Similarly, social networks need activity to keep from becoming stale. To build relationships---not just contacts---as you meet new people act with sincerity and generosity. This approach will allow you to build trust and mutual respect and ultimately maintain and strengthen friendships over time.
