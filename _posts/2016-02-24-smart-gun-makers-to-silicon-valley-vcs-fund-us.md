# Smart Gun Makers To Silicon Valley VCs: Fund Us

Smart gun makers have had to overcome fierce opposition from traditional gun rights groups. Now, they are trying to win over another cutthroat group with lots of clout: Silicon Valley investors.

Dozens of key players in the still-nascent smart gun industry gathered in San Francisco on Tuesday to pique the interest of potential funders, trying to raise awareness about the financial -- and social -- potential of the technology. Silicon Valley's most vocal supporter so far is

, who has backed early efforts to apply biometric technologies to guns and claim a major segment of the multi-billion dollar industry. So far, the money he's wrangled for smart guns has been a pittance by Valley startup standards, and it doesn't appear he'll get a return on his investment any time soon. But that's not stopping Conway from throwing

his influence behind it.

"Half the guns sold in 10 years will be smart guns," Conway predicted on Tuesday. Smart guns encompass a wide array of technologies but are generally understood as weapons that are "user authorized." In other words, only the gun owner and whomever he or she chooses can fire the gun. Early smart gun makers have accomplished this with prototypes using biometric fingerprint technology and RFID technology, among others.

"This could be a very big market," said Ralph Fascitelli, president of the gun violence prevention group CeaseFire and co-organizer of Tuesday's event. "We're talking billions of dollars annually."
