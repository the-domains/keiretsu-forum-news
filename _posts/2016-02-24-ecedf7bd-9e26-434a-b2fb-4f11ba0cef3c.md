# The Pebble Beach Chapter - Keiretsu Forum

The Pebble Beach Chapter of
Keiretsu Forum, covering most of Santa Cruz and Monterey counties and into Big
Sur, has just been formed. Our first physical meetings will start soon and we
plan to start online meetings and related in March. As a business activity,
your trips to Pebble Beach meetings may now be deductible! Watch for the announcement
of those meetings here, and let your contacts in the central coast area of
California know to contact me if they want to join, pitch, or just find out
about us. fred@keiretsuforum.com
