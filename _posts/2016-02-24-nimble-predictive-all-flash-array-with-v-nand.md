# Nimble Predictive All Flash Array With V-NAND

Nimble Storage has been known for its hybrid storage systems that combine flash memory and storage together in order to provide an optimized trade-off between performance and storage costs. The company introduced its first All Flash Array (AFA) with predictive analytic features and the ability to cluster this array with their existing hybrid storage arrays to provide a large flexible storage pool.
