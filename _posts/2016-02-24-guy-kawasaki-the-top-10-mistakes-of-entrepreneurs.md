# Guy Kawasaki: The Top 10 Mistakes Of Entrepreneurs

Few people have seen more of the dumb mistakes entrepreneurs make than [Guy Kawasaki][0], the former Apple evangelist and venture capitalist who has since written 13 books on entrepreneurship, startups, and running businesses.

Today at a two-day conference held in Silicon Valley by the startup community network Startup Grind, Kawasaki, now chief evangelist of graphic design service Canva and executive fellow of Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, held forth on the top 10 miscues made by entrepreneurs.

If you pay any attention to Kawasaki, you've probably heard this presentation before, because he has done it many times. But that's OK. Not only does he update and refine it a bit each time, today is a new day for tech entrepreneurs, as venture capitalists cut back and once-darling startups see their valuations hacked to pieces.
