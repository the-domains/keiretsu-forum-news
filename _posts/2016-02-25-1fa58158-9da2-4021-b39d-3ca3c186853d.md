# Keiretsu Forum TRISTATE Launch

It is
with great excitement and anticipation that the 43rd Chapter of Keiretsu Forum has
launched its operations in the mid-west by building the TRISTATE Chapter in
Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana, with our first operations in Cincinnati, Ohio.

An informational meeting with prospective members, partners, and growth companies will take place at 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday, March 9th, 2016 at the TAFT Center, in Cincinnati, Ohio (425 Walnut Street, Cincinnati, Ohio). This event is being hosted by Taft, Stettinius & Hollister LLP.

Founding member and CEO, Randy Williams will attend this event
to discuss Keiretsu Forum, its global footprint, and its organic growth to an
organization of over 2500 members since 2000\.  The president of the
TRISTATE Chapter, Sotiris Pagdadis, will discuss the importance of the chapter
to the region, and how the benefits of this global organization can be realized
both by prospective members and growth companies alike in the Tri-State
region.  The event will be followed by light cocktails to provide
interested parties the opportunity to connect.

If you
are interested in attending the event, please contact the president directly at: sotiris@keiretsuforum.com. We will also be following up with an event invitation. 

We truly look forward to connecting with you at this exciting event.
