# Hacking Into Cyber Criminals' Heads

Illusive Networks, the first member of Israeli cybersecurity syndicate Team8, today announced Attacker View, a technology highlighting the links, access and privilege escalation options, and unseen attack paths that are used by cyber criminals on an enterprise network.

Launched last June, Illusive Networks has turned the tables on the attackers, by exploiting their psychology and the way they work inside a company's network once they penetrate it. "We said let's focus on the attacker, and specifically, let's focus on the attacker's vulnerabilities," says Shlomo Touboul, Illusive's CEO. "We have very intimate knowledge of attackers because most of Illusive's R&D staff has served in \[Israel's elite cybersecurity Intelligence Corps Unit\] 8200 and have been attackers for many years," he adds.
