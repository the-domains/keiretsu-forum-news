# Spotify Moving Onto Google Cloud Is A Big Win For Google Over Amazon And Microsoft

Behind the curtain of its app offering easy access to 30 million songs, Spotify engineers have been running around keeping the music flowing in physical data centers---until now. Spotify's online streaming is now going to run on Google Cloud. Its choice of Google represents a significant win for new chief[Diane Greene and her growing team][0]as they take on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft.

For years, Spotify has bought or leased its own data centers, the company said in a[blog post][1]announcing the move on Tuesday. The idea, writes vice president of engineering and infrastructure Nicholas Harteau, was to house music data as close to customers as possible. "Operating our own data-centers may be a pain, but the core cloud services were not at a level of quality, performance and cost that would make cloud a significantly better option for Spotify in the long run," Harteau wrote.
